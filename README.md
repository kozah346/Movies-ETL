# Movies-ETL

## Purpose of Analysis
The following analysis was done by creating data pipelines through the process of Extract, Transform and Load. Movie data was gathered from both Wikipedia and Kaggle. To do this, the ETL process was followed as below:

* Extracted Wikipedia and Kaggle data from respective files.
* Transformed datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together.
* Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database. 

The analysis was, in further stages, modified to help create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
